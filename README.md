# WebProgramming_VM
This is a virtual machine which contains all the necessary tools to code in Python for the Web Programming course.

The VM is a Debian 8 64bit installation. The user is named **np** and the password for both the user and the root is **qazxsw21** (please **change it**).

If you need to install these tools on your own, for Debian-based machines:

`apt-get install vim sqlite python-sqlalchemy python-tornado python-flask python-flask-httpauth python-flask-login git python-twisted-web python-twisted-web2 python-simplejson python-passlib python-bcrypt python-scrypt python-django libapache2-mod-python eclipse`

In the VM you will also find pre-installed:
* eclipse (with pydev), 
* Komode Edit, 
* Atom (with several plugins),
* PyCharm (Community version)

Uncompress the files, add it to your Virtual Box or vmware, and have fun.
